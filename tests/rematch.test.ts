/**
 * rematch.test.ts — live-P2P contract gate #3, the protocol half.
 *
 * "Play again" is where multiplayer games go to die. The obvious implementation
 * (leave the room, rejoin it) is a trap that net-lifecycle.test.ts nails shut; the
 * correct one — keep one living room and version the rounds inside it — has its
 * own failure modes, and they are the ones this file pins:
 *
 *  - TWO ROUNDS STARTING. Both peers tap at the same instant and each fires a
 *    start. Unstrung is a same-seed race, so two starts means two seeds, which
 *    means two different maps, resource caches and cold curves scored against
 *    each other on one ladder. Nothing errors; the scoreboard is just fiction.
 *  - DISAGREEING ABOUT WHO IS WHO. If each peer derives the roster locally,
 *    player 0 on one screen is player 1 on the other, and the standings strip
 *    confidently puts the winner's score under the loser's name.
 *  - DISAGREEING ABOUT THE MODE. Unstrung's modes change the MAP RADIUS, the
 *    number of days and the starting heat (see src/modes.ts). Two peers reading
 *    their own local mode picker are racing Thaw's 9 days against Longnight's
 *    12, on different maps, with no error anywhere.
 *  - DEADLOCKING ON SOMEONE WHO LEFT. A vote from a peer who then closed their
 *    tab must not hold the room open forever.
 *
 * The bus is an in-memory stand-in for the mesh (tests/helpers/bus.ts): this file
 * tests DECISIONS, not transport.
