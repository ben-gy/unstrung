/**
 * net-lifecycle.test.ts — live-P2P contract gate #3, and the most valuable
 * trivial test in the suite.
 *
 * ONE ROOM PER SESSION. The obvious way to write "Play again" is to leave the
 * room and rejoin it, and it is a trap with no visible failure. Trystero memoizes
 * joinRoom on appId+roomId while room.leave() defers its real teardown behind a
 * ~99ms timer, so a same-tick rejoin hands back the room that is about to be
 * destroyed. Moments later the deferred teardown unsubscribes from every relay
 * and clears the announce loop, and the "fresh" Net is a corpse: permanently
 * deaf, roster of one. Both players then sit in the correct room code, alone,
 * each believing they are the host.
 *
 * It is deterministic, it is permanent, and on screen it looks exactly like a
 * flaky relay — which is why it survived so long. The engine now makes the trap
 * throw at the call site, and this file asserts that it does, plus the invariant
 * the whole design rests on: a whole session, however many runs of Unstrung,
 * performs exactly ONE join.
 *
 * The triviality is the point. Nothing here needs a network, and that is why it
 * can run on every commit.
