/**
 * no-deadlock.test.ts — live-P2P contract gate #5.
 *
 * The rule "start when EVERYONE has readied up" is correct and unshippable. One
 * player still reading the ladder, or gone to answer the door, or simply not
 * tapping, holds the entire room hostage with no way out but the menu — and from
 * the other seat it is indistinguishable from the game having crashed, because
 * nothing on screen is moving.
 *
 * So the contract is: a peer that never votes must NOT be able to hold the room.
 * Quorum starts a visible countdown; when it expires the round starts without the
 * straggler. Unanimity still starts instantly, because nobody should be made to
 * wait out a timer they have already satisfied. And losing quorum cancels the
 * countdown, because a countdown that keeps running toward a start that cannot
 * legally happen is worse than no countdown at all.
 *
 * `startsInMs` is part of the contract, not a nicety: a silent wait and a hang
 * look identical. Unstrung applies the same rule one layer down, in race.ts,
 * where the ladder publishes on a visible countdown from the first finisher
 * rather than waiting on everyone forever — same principle, same reason.
