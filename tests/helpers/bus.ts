/**
 * bus.ts — an in-memory stand-in for the P2P mesh, for PROTOCOL tests only.
 *
 * It models the three things rematch.ts and the lobby actually depend on: a
 * roster, an elected host, and named channels that deliver to peers who are still
 * in the room. It deliberately does NOT model transport — no relays, no ICE, no
 * flakiness — because the decisions being tested (who starts a round, with which
 * roster, at which number) must be correct before transport is even interesting.
 *
 * Delivery is QUEUED and drained by `flush()`, never synchronous. Real trystero
 * sends are async, and a synchronous bus quietly changes the interleaving — a
 * start would be received and acked before the sender had even recorded that it
 * sent one, which is an ordering that can never happen in production and would
 * make the test lie in both directions.
